# Random Incoherent Sentence Generator#

## Project
In this repository I constructed a random sentence generator from the 1000 most commonly used words in the english language. 

### Areas of improvement###
1. Ultilize some api in order to pull data from webster's dictionary in order to make the words more robust
2. From each word selected, categorize it as an adj, noun, verb and have sentence that can be created in respect to each part of speech
3. Allow for more flexibility in sentences constructed, which may involve in more logic in order to handle various possibilties
